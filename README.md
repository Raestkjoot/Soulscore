# Soulscore (working title)

This is a project I am working on to create a nice portfolio 
project while learning and improving on my programming skills, 
especially focussing on code architecture and the SOLID principles.

This game is being developed in collaboration with an artist friend who is
mainly responsible for concept art and story, while I do the programming and developing in Unity. 
Who makes the art assets? Good question, we'll see once we get to that point.

Taking inspiration from some of my favorite games: Hades, Dark Souls, League of Legends, Zelda, and more! 
The core gameplay should be similar to Hades, an isometric action rpg, with cool ability and dialogue systems.
